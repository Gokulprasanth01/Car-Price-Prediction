# **Car-Price-Prediction**

####  • Developed a machine learning model that predicts the car price after pre-processing the data.
####  • Using Power BI, created dynamic dashboard for car price prediction.

## Dataset

#### Thanks Kaggle to find my [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/car-price-prediction) to use

## Pre-Processing

#### - EDA
#### - Checking Null values
#### - Numeric values with Scatte plots
#### - Distribution and Outliers
#### - Categorical values into numerical represtation

## Feature Importance

#### -> Split the data into X &y
#### -> Run a tree based estimators (i.e. DT or RF)
#### -> Run Feature Importance

## Decision Tree

#### Decision Tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. 

## Linear Regression

#### Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

###   Tools : `Python`, `Power BI`
